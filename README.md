## 🚀 Projects

- **Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews using NLP**  
  - Developed a sentiment analysis pipeline using Python, applying both VADER and RoBERTa transformer models on a dataset of over 500,000 Amazon product reviews.  
  - Implemented data preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, and text vectorization using NLTK and Scikit-learn to prepare text for analysis.  
  - Performed model evaluation and sentiment score comparison, identifying strengths of rule-based (VADER) and deep learning-based (RoBERTa) approaches.  
  - Visualized sentiment trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to draw insights into consumer behavior across product categories.

- **Advance Filtering for Amazon Rating, Reviews and Returns**  
  - Developed a Flask-based web application integrating live web scraping using Selenium and a fine-tuned BERT model to classify Amazon product reviews as genuine or fake.  
  - Achieved 91.45% classification accuracy on a balanced dataset using HuggingFace Transformers and PyTorch for binary sentiment modeling.  
  - Engineered a logarithmic-based Trust Score formula combining star rating and review count to quantitatively estimate product reliability.  
  - Designed a user-friendly interface to display product metadata, real vs. fake review distribution, and actionable trust insights to guide purchasing decisions.
